# LearningJavaScript

Welcome to the **LearningJavaScript** repository! This repository is designed to help you understand the fundamental concepts of JavaScript through practical examples. It contains organized folders with `.js` files that cover essential topics such as arrays, loops, and conditionals.

## Repository Structure

### 1. `arrays/`
This folder contains JavaScript files that demonstrate how to work with arrays. You'll find examples of:
- Creating and initializing arrays
- Manipulating array elements (adding, removing, updating)
- Iterating over arrays using different methods
- Utilizing built-in array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`

### 2. `loops/`
The `loops` folder includes examples of various looping constructs in JavaScript. The files in this folder cover:
- `for` loops: Standard iteration over arrays or ranges
- `while` and `do-while` loops: Running loops based on conditions
- Loop control statements like `break` and `continue`
- Nested loops for working with multi-dimensional arrays

### 3. `conditionals/`
In the `conditionals` folder, you'll find JavaScript files that focus on conditional statements and logical operators. These examples illustrate:
- `if`, `else if`, and `else` statements for decision-making
- `switch` statements for handling multiple conditions
- Ternary operators for concise conditional expressions
- Logical operators (`&&`, `||`, `!`) for combining conditions

## How to Run the `.js` Files

To run the JavaScript files in this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LearningJavaScript.git


2. **Navigate to the Folder:** Change directory to one of the folders (`arrays`, `loops`, or `conditionals`) where the `.js` file you want to run is located:

    ```bash
    cd LearningJavaScript/arrays
    ```

3. **Run the JavaScript File:** You can run the `.js` file using Node.js. If you have Node.js installed, use the following command:

    ```bash
    node filename.js
    ```

    Replace `filename.js` with the actual name of the file you want to execute.

    **Example:**

    ```bash
    node exampleArray.js
    ```

## Conclusion

This repository serves as a hands-on guide to mastering basic JavaScript concepts. Feel free to explore the folders, modify the code, and experiment to deepen your understanding of JavaScript.
